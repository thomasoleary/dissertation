using occurance and placement statistics based on a training database of CAD model layouts.

data-driven model that learns from the SUNCG database that contains over 250,000 rooms designed by humans.

learns conditional statistics


method is fully automatic
    does allow flexibility with user-specified constraints

types of constraints
    room size & shape & type
    accessibility
    gap placement/clearance
    locations of furniture
    locations of doors, windows

presents a user study
    comparing their models against human made

    models are realistic and compare favourably to human designs



algorithm
    randomly sample room type
        from 9 room types that are learned during training
    sample furniture based upon the room type
    numbers/instances of each item are determined by parameters learns during training
    once all items are picked, a "deterministic placement algorithm" calculates their placements'
    ceiling & wall objects are sampled, furniture is placed

the model uses SUNCG dataset for its training
    a dataset that contains over 45,000 apartment layouts created by humans
    2500 furniture CAD models are categorised
    each model is assigned an object class - there are 170 object classes (television, bathtub, armchair)

unconstrained layouts
    generate in 0.04s on average

constrained layouts
    generate between 0.04s-112s
        this is entirely dependent on what constraints are set
        room type, excluding certain objects and clearance constraints generated in 0.04s on average
        whereas room size + doors + window constraints took 112s on average

user study
    presented 1400 pairs of images to 8 non-experts
	asked to identify the image with a more realistic/natural layout of objects
	in each case, one image was human and the other a layout from the model
	order of the image was randomised each pair

results
    unconstrained
        presented in 2 different styles
            1st person
            overhead
        the model was slightly preferred in 1st person
        the model was indistinguishable from human designs in overhead

    constrained
        only overhead
        two sets of constraints
            1. fixed room size & placement of a singular object
            2. fixed room size & door/window locations

        1. model layouts are indistinguishable
        2. human designs were preffered
