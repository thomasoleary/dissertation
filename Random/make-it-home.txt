make-it-home

hierarchial and spatial relationships

ergonomic factors
    visibility/accessibility

assembled into a cost function
    yields "realistc furninute arrangements"


cost function is optimised using a Metropolis-Hastings state search step

perceptual study
    perceived functionality of the automatically synthesized results relative to human designed arrangements

    two hypothesis
        1. users perceive no significant difference between synthesized and human designed arrangements
        2. users do perceive significant differences

        25 volunteers
            unaware of the purpose of the study

        "select the one you would prefer to live, say, work, visit"








chi-square analysis
    only one dimension

bayesian analysis
    determine the number of participants who selected the synthesized layout was what would be expected by chance
    or a preferance pattern
    binomial distribution
