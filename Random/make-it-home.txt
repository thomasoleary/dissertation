assembled into a cost function
    yields "realistc furninute arrangements"


cost function is optimised using a Metropolis-Hastings state search step


relationships
    spatial
        distance of an object to its nearest wall & orientation
    hierarchial
        given two objects A & B 
            A is defined as the parent of B
                if A is supporting B by a certain surface
                example, candle (B) placed on a table (A)
        all objects supported by the floor/wall (seen as the root)
            are considered "first-tier objects"
                (bed, table, clock on the wall)
            objects supported by a first-tier are considered second-tier objects
                (candle, plate)
    pairwise
        certain objects interact with eachother in pairs
            subject to pairwise orientation and distance constraints
                (TV and a Sofa, table and chairs)
        these can be set by selecting two objects in the UI 
            the mean relative distance and angles are extracted
                used for pairwise constraints

with these prior defined relationships
    a cost function is used to quantify the quality of the arrangement

furniture positions and orientations depend on numerous factors
    whether the object should be visible or accessible
    to tackle the issue of global optimisation simulated annealing and a Metropolis-Hastings state search step is used.
    
    simulated annealing
        computational imitation of the annealing process
            gradually lowers the temperature of a bath that controls the thermal dynamics of a solid to bring it into a low-energy state. (CITE PAPER ABOUT SIMULATED ANNEALING).

        furniture is originally set to be "heated up" to allow flexible arrangement and are able to refine their arrangement as they "cool down"
        Each temperature decrement, Metropolis-Hastings is used to determine the furnitures transition probability. (CITE PAPER ABOUT M-H ALGORITHM)
            in other words the M-H algorithm is used to pass multiple positional values of the furniture to the simulated annealing function

cost function
    accessible
        object must be "accessible" to be functional
            cost increases when an object moves into the accessible area of another object (higher cost == higher priority)
        the objects position is measure in the cost function
    visibility
        some objects must be viewed from a specific direction
            (TV, painting etc)
        every object that must be "visible"
            a "viewing frustrum" constraint is applied
        if an object moves into another objects viewing frustrum
            cost increases in order to make a change to this (higher cost == higher priority)
                cost function for this is similar but instead of the objects accessible space
                    its viewing frustrum values are used
    pathway
        the paths in the furniture arrangement are defined by a cubic bezier curve
            approximated by a series of rectangular objects
        changing the path would be as simple as changing the control points of the bezier curves
        cost function is similar to that of visibility
            but applied to the rectangular objects in the pathway
    prior
        extract prior distance & orientation of the nearest wall from each furniture
        prior distance & orientation is subtracted from the current position value of the furniture (distance & orientation)
    pairwise
        the pairwise cost function is defined similar to that of prior cost function
            such that the distance and orientation values are between paired furniture 
                rather than dist and orientation of the nearest wall etc

    overall cost function
        accessible + visibility + pathway + prior + pairwise
        each function being given an individual weighting

perceptual study
    perceived functionality of the automatically synthesized results relative to human designed arrangements

    two hypothesis
        1. users perceive no significant difference between synthesized and human designed arrangements
        2. users do perceive significant differences

        25 volunteers
            unaware of the purpose of the study
            14 of which said they did not have any expertise in interior design

        each participant viewed a total of 35 pairs (total of 70 images)
            5 paired comparison * 7 scenarios * (1 synthesized & 1 human)

        "select the one you would prefer to live, say, work, visit"

        synthesized model is considered if human designed arrangements are not "clear" winners

        of the 35 pairs shown
            13 of which showed that the synthesized model was preferred






chi-square analysis
    only one dimension

bayesian analysis
    determine the number of participants who selected the synthesized layout was what would be expected by chance
    or a preferance pattern
    binomial distribution
