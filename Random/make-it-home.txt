hierarchial and spatial relationships

ergonomic factors
    visibility/accessibility

assembled into a cost function
    yields "realistc furninute arrangements"


cost function is optimised using a Metropolis-Hastings state search step

perceptual study
    perceived functionality of the automatically synthesized results relative to human designed arrangements

    two hypothesis
        1. users perceive no significant difference between synthesized and human designed arrangements
        2. users do perceive significant differences

        25 volunteers
            unaware of the purpose of the study

        "select the one you would prefer to live, say, work, visit"

relationships
    spatial
        distance of an object to its nearest wall & orientation
    hierarchial
        given two objects A & B 
            A is defined as the parent of B
                if A is supporting B by a certain surface
                example, candle (B) placed on a table (A)
        all objects supported by the floor/wall (seen as the root)
            are considered "first-tier objects"
                (bed, table, clock on the wall)
            objects supported by a first-tier are considered second-tier objects
                (candle, plate)
    pairwise
        certain objects interact with eachother in pairs
            subject to pairwise orientation and distance constraints
                (TV and a Sofa, table and chairs)
        these can be set by selecting two objects in the UI 
            the mean relative distance and angles are extracted
                used for pairwise constraints

with these prior defined relationships
    a cost function is used to quantify the qualify of the arrangement

furniture positions and orientations depend on numerous factors
    whether the object should be visible or accessible
    to tackle the issue of global optimisation simulated annealing and a Metropolis-Hastings state search step is used.
    
    simulated annealing
        computational imitation of the annealing process
            gradually lowers the temperature of a bath that controls the thermal dynamics of a solid to bring it into a low-energy state. (CITE PAPER ABOUT SIMULATED ANNEALING).

        furniture is originally set to be "heated up" to allow flexible arrangement and are able to refine their arrangement as they "cool down"
        Each temperature decrement Metropolis-Hastings is used to determine the furnitures transition probability.
        






chi-square analysis
    only one dimension

bayesian analysis
    determine the number of participants who selected the synthesized layout was what would be expected by chance
    or a preferance pattern
    binomial distribution
