Procedural Arrangement of Furniture for Real-Time Walkthroughs

each furniture is seen as an individual agent that seeks a suitable parent furniture object.


tool furnishes the rooms in the vicinity of the player, while exploring the building

introduces a multi-agent based solution

disadvantages to modelling every room
    difficult to store, manage and render
    impractical to manually do
    viewer would only view a limited number of rooms anyway

paper produces a procedural solution that generates the furniture needed in order to create the illusion of entire interiors

initially the building is empty - the interiors are then created at run time just before they become vivisble to the player

requirements
    system has to generate furniture arrangementss rapidly while the player explores
    arrangements must be persistent, such that they appear to be unaltered if a user re-enters a room
    interiors must be plausible & interesting

agents that employ local rules and simple heuristics instead of contact constraints

arrange dynamically

the paper regards single pieces of furniture as autonomous agents that can move around a predefined room to arrange themselves properly
automatic heirachies

different parts of the room are root parents for agents
    agents can recognise these parts

object layout algorithm
    initialise all rooms
    create agents corresponding to the room
    agents set to search
    perform agent actions until all are set to "rest" or deleted

search
    starts in this state
    searches for possible parent
    if finds a parent suitable for its semantics
        changes state to arrange
    if it cant find a parent, agent is deleted

arrange
    attempts to place and orient itself
    looks for collisions
        uses separating axis thereom for collision detection
    if collisions
        re arranges with parent
    if none
        changes state to rest

rest
    other agents can now become child of this object (if matching semantics)
    if this agents parent moves, it moves accordingly
        if this results in collisions
            state changes to search
    agents in this state tend not to move


prioritizes agents depth in the hierarchy
    table placed before chairs etc
