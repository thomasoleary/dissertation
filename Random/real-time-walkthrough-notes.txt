Procedural Arrangement of Furniture for Real-Time Walkthroughs

tool furnishes the rooms in the vicinity of the player, while exploring the building

introduces a multi-agent based solution

disadvantages to modelling every room
    difficult to store, manage and render
    impractical to manually do
    viewer would only view a limited number of rooms anyway

paper produces a procedural solution that generates the furniture needed in order to create the illusion of entire interiors

initially the building is empty - the interiors are then created at run time just before they become vivisble to the player

requirements
    system has to generate furniture arrangementss rapidly while the player explores
    arrangements must be persistent, such that they appear to be unaltered if a user re-enters a room
    interiors must be plausible & interesting

agents that employ local rules and simple heuristics instead of contact constraints

arrange dynamically

the paper regards single pieces of furniture as autonomous agents that can move around a predefined room to arrange themselves properly
automatic heirachies


goal of agent
    find suitable parent, place, orient itself properly
    also respect physical constraints (must not collide with other objects other than its parent)
each agent contains 
    its own size (bounding box)
    class of possible parent objects (and for each class the sides where the agent can place itself)
    occupation of its own sides (describes each face of its box, how much space, how many available places are left for children)

the semantics allow functional relationships
    create plausible object layouts
    for e.g.
        chair may stand next to a table or be solitary
            several possible parents

agent collision is based on the separating axis thereom

3 states
    search
    arrange
    rest


prioritizes agents depth in the hierarchy
    table placed before chairs etc

different parts of the room are root parents for agents
    agents can recognise these parts

object layout algorithm
    initialise all rooms
    create agents corrseponding to the room
    agents set to search
    perform agent actions until all are set to "rest" or deleted
