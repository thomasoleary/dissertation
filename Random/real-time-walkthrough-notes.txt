Procedural Arrangement of Furniture for Real-Time Walkthroughs

each furniture is seen as an individual agent that seeks a suitable parent furniture object.


tool furnishes the rooms in the vicinity of the player, while exploring the building

introduces a multi-agent based solution

disadvantages to modelling every room
    difficult to store, manage and render
    impractical to manually do
    viewer would only view a limited number of rooms anyway

paper produces a procedural solution that generates the furniture needed in order to create the illusion of entire interiors

initially the building is empty - the interiors are then created at run time just before they become vivisble to the player

requirements
    system has to generate furniture arrangementss rapidly while the player explores
    arrangements must be persistent, such that they appear to be unaltered if a user re-enters a room
    interiors must be plausible & interesting

agents that employ local rules and simple heuristics instead of contact constraints

arrange dynamically

the paper regards single pieces of furniture as autonomous agents that can move around a predefined room to arrange themselves properly
automatic heirachies

different parts of the room are root parents for agents
    agents can recognise these parts

object layout algorithm
    initialise all rooms
    create agents corresponding to the room
    agents set to search
    perform agent actions until all are set to "rest" or deleted

search
    starts in this state
    searches for possible parent
    if finds a parent suitable for its semantics
        changes state to arrange
    if it cant find a parent, agent is deleted

arrange
    attempts to place and orient itself
    looks for collisions
        uses separating axis thereom for collision detection
    if collisions
        re arranges with parent
    if none
        changes state to rest

rest
    other agents can now become child of this object (if matching semantics)
    if this agents parent moves, it moves accordingly
        if this results in collisions
            state changes to search
    agents in this state tend not to move

rooms are responsible for the creation of the agents
    they manage existing agents, allowing the other agents to easily find parents
    Different parts of the rooms are root parents for the agents
        floor, wall, window, door


the room is created only when the player is close
    rooms are despawned/discarded once the player is too far away 
    does not guarantee that room is furnished when visible to player

persistence
    when player leaves room, it should be discarded
    but this will cause a different room to be arranged if the player were to enter the same room
    to guarantee that the room will be the same, a seed is applied to the furnished layout based on its position and number


user input
    apply tags to parts of the room 
        wall floor door etc
    how many objects, what types and how many of each type can be used in this room
    semantic description of each object
        possible parents (and what sides to correspond with)
        clearance distance for object
        possible orientation values

the tool doesn't have a set specified hierarchy
    this is handled within the semantic descriptions of the objects where the user manually sets parent objects
    system automatically works out heirachy at run-time
