TT-artistic-creativity

considers the TT in the domain of art
    passed "behaviourally"
        non-interactive examples "AARON" and "Emmy" have passed in strong from

raises a problem concerning the concept of creativity
    personal opinion
    may be no such thing as computer art because there is no such thing as computer creativity

provides further discussion about the immitation game
    in the context of computational creativity



A regular TT is rather different to the TT in the context of art creativity

proposes a TT oriented around art

the human carrying out the TT contemplates
    (listens to, looks at, sometimes interacts with)
    the result produced by the computer for five minutes

for the "artistic" program to pass the TT
    (1) indistinguishable from one produced by a human being
    and/or
    (2) was seen as having much aesthetic value as one produced by a human being

(2) the machines performance might only be comparable only to realtively mediocre human art
    or world class

could count as passing the TT regardless
    the original TT did not require the machine to be "mistaken for a highly skilled wordsmith"

computer artwork that completely independant from human intervention can be considered for the TT
    computer assisted art does not count
    photoshop does not count

    non-interactive computer art would provide a stronger pass than interactive
        the more direct the human influence - the less persuasive the "pass"

        bodily movements could make the colours change unpredictably
            may not be aware of this is happening
            cannot mould the artwork in a particular way due to the unpredictably
            creative responsibility is highly limited
