uses a data set of 45000 apartment layouts created by humans

types of contstraints
	room size and type
	traversability
	gap placement & clearance
	object placement
	doors, windows, refurnishing

parameters can be altered
	for e.g. can manually set a specific clearance constraint on a specific side of object

user study
	presented 1400 pairs of images to 8 non-experts
	asked to identify the image with a more realistic/natural layout of objects
	in each case, one image was human and the other a layout from the model
	order of the image was randomised each pair


results from user study
	unconstrained
		presented images in 2 views
			overheard
			1st person
		1st person was slightly preferred
		overhead layouts are indistinguishable from human designs

	constrained
		only overhead view
		two sets of constraints
			1. fixed room size & placement of one object
			2. fixed room size & door/window locations
		
		1. model layouts are indistinguishable from human designs up to statistical significance
		2. human designs were preffered


unconstrained items generate in 0.04s on average
constrained items generate anywhere between 0.04-112 seconds
	size + doors + windows generate in 112 seconds on average
