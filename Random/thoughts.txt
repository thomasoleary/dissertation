introduction

    urban open world games such as the Grand Theft Auto series, Watchdogs series and the Batman Arkham series
    have such large built-up urban areas for players to venture in but many buildings/rooms inside buildings are blocked off, stopping players from exploring inside.

    simply, designers could model these interiors by themselves but due to the ever increasing nature of open world games - this would become and already is impractical and very time consuming/

    using procedural generation techniques, this time consuming task can be automated to allow designers to focus on other things blah blah blah

    the issue at hand is procedural generation can tend to be repetitive, dull and could potentially ruin the emersion of a game.

    this study looks to see if someone is able to tell the difference between hand made and AI generated interiors.

    see if generated interiors are wanted/viable?*



questionnaire?
    questionnaire towards the end of participation
    asks why you selected certain rooms
    

    do you play urban open world games?*
        which ones
        what do you like about the exploration in these games?
        what do you not like about the exploration in these games?
        how do you think the exploration in these games can be improved?
