  abstract = {We present a system that automatically synthesizes indoor scenes realistically populated by a variety of furniture objects. Given examples of sensibly furnished indoor scenes, our system extracts, in advance, hierarchical and spatial relationships for various furniture objects, encoding them into priors associated with ergonomic factors, such as visibility and accessibility, which are assembled into a cost function whose optimization yields realistic furniture arrangements. To deal with the prohibitively large search space, the cost function is optimized by simulated annealing using a Metropolis-Hastings state search step. We demonstrate that our system can synthesize multiple realistic furniture arrangements and, through a perceptual study, investigate whether there is a significant difference in the perceived functionality of the automatically synthesized results relative to furniture arrangements produced by human designers.},

  abstract = {We try to clarify the concept of procedural content generation (PCG) through contrasting it to other forms of content generation in games with which it could easily be mistaken, and through discussing some properties of PCG which are sometimes thought of as necessary but are actually not. After drawing up some clear demarcations for what is and what is not PCG, we present two versions of a content generation system for Infinite Mario Bros which is intentionally designed to question these same demarcations. We argue that, according to our own definition, one version of the system is an example of PCG while the other is not, even though they are mostly identical. We hope that this paper answers some questions but raises others, and inspires researchers and developers to thread some less common ground in developing content generation techniques.},
