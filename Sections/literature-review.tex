\section{Literature Review}
My literature review consists of two parts that I believe to be important to my research question.
It first describes different implementations of Procedural Interior Generation (PCIG) then explores
ways in which Artificial Intelligence (AI) is compared to Humans.
\\
\subsection{Implementations of Procedural Interior Generation}
Procedural Interior Generation (PCIG) in the video games industry is currently unheard of.

"ai generated internal environments based on external geometry"

\subsubsection*{Multi-Agent System}
Go on to talk about the different papers I have "read" about Procedural Interior Generation.
What techniques/algorithms they used etc. etc. \cite{real-time-walkthroughs}
\subsubsection*{Rule-Based Layout}
\subsubsection*{Statistical Relationships}


\subsection{Artificial Intelligence Compared to Humans}
This is going to be a little more difficult to right about, as I haven't read a paper on this so far.
And I have only managed to find 3 papers that talk about this, but I am not sure that they could be entirely relevant.
