\section{Literature Review}

This literature review has two sections. The first will go on to 
explain different techniques that 
have been used to procedurally generate interiors.
An

This section reviews literature on different Procedural Interior Generation (PCIG) techniques 
and the comparison of Artificial Intelligence to Humans.

Start of this section should be a small introduction on my literature review.
\\
Perhaps I should end the literature review as to why they are important?
Yes, so I can lead into why testing PCIG against human designs is an untapped market.

\subsection{Procedural Interior Generation}

\subsubsection*{Multi-Agent System}
Go on to talk about the different papers I have "read" about Procedural Interior Generation.
What techniques/algorithms they used etc. etc. \cite{real-time-walkthroughs}
\subsubsection*{Rule-Based Layout}
\subsubsection*{}


\subsection{Artificial Intelligence Compared to Humans}
This is going to be a little more difficult to right about, as I haven't read a paper on this so far.
And I have only managed to find 3 papers that talk about this, but I am not sure that they could be entirely relevant.
