\section{Literature Review}

Start of this section should be a small introduction on my literature review.
\\
Perhaps I should end the literature review as to why they are important?
Yes, so I can lead into why testing PCIG against human designs is an untapped market.

\subsection{Procedural Interior Generation}
Go on to talk about the different papers I have "read" about Procedural Interior Generation.
What techniques/algorithms they used etc. etc. \cite{real-time-walkthroughs}


\subsection{Artificial Intelligence Compared to Humans}
This is going to be a little more difficult to right about, as I haven't read a paper on this so far.
And I have only managed to find 3 papers that talk about this, but I am not sure that they could be entirely relevant.
