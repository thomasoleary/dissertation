\section{Literature Review}
My literature review consists of two parts that I believe to be important to my research question.
It first describes different implementations of Procedural Interior Generation (PCIG) then explores
ways in which Artificial Intelligence (AI) is compared to Humans.

\subsection{Implementations of Procedural Interior Generation}
Although PCG has a lot to show and offer in game development - being used for
characters, terrain, weapons and textures - the use of Procedural Interior Generation 
(PCIG) in games however is scarcely come by.
\\
A game that does use PCIG is Catlateral Damage Remeowstered\cite{game:catlateral},
a small indie game developed by Manekoware where you play as a cat on a destructive rampage 
in its own house.
In 2017, Chris Chung (the indie developer behind the game) wrote a case study about the level design in his game \cite{what-is-pcg}.
When developing Catlateral Damage, Chung was 
undecided on how to design the levels and ultimately went for PCG and PCIG\cite{pcg_in_gd}.
Before the interior decoration can take place, a Squarified Treemap algorithm 
is used to generate the room layouts and floor plans within the level \cite{squarified-treemap}.
Each room generated from this algorithm has an associated data file, which contains the type of furniture available, maximum type of each furniture, spawn probabilities, if the furniture is placeable on walls and if the player will spawn there.
The furniture objects that can be placed have physics components attached to allow them to be accurately placed within the level -
for this, a Rectangle Packing algorithm is used to place these objects within allocated surface areas on the floor and other furniture objects.
Concluding the case study, Chung states that most players could not notice that the levels were procedurally generated.
\textbf{Although this is a promising statement, Chung has not shown any evidence to back this claim. I have emailed Chung about this statement.}

On 29th April 2021, Sony Interactive Entertainment published patent US20210121781, 
titled "AI-Generated Internal Environments Based On External Geometry" \cite{sony-patent}.
The patents' description goes onto explain a 
Machine Learning (ML) tool that takes in data from the external structure of a virtual building
and generates an interior environment just from this data.
Although this is just a patent for an ML tool, this could be the start of PCIG being used in AAA Titles. 

\subsection{Artificial Intelligence Compared to Humans}
This is going to be a little more difficult to right about, as I haven't read a paper on this so far.
And I have only managed to find 3 papers that talk about this, but I am not sure that they could be entirely relevant.
