\section{Artefact}

A Multi-Agent (M-A) system will be created that generates the interior of a room at run time. This system is given a pre-defined room size to generate in and will also have access to pre-made furniture assets. It will be influenced by the work from \textit{T. Germer, et al.} \cite{real-time-walkthroughs} and will be implemented into the Unity game engine (Version 2020.3.12) \cite{unity}.

%The system will involve using Unity's ScriptableObject class to hold the information about the furniture objects.

%\subsection{What will be made}
%A Multi-Agent (M-A) system that generates the interior of a room at run time. This room will have a pre-defined room size, the system will also have access to pre-made furniture assets.
%\hl{Something about using Real-Time walkthrough paper as an inspiration for the system}.

%\subsection{How will I create it}
%The AI will be made in the Unity game engine (Version 2020.3.12f1) \textbf{cite unity engine}

\subsection{How will I ensure Quality}
Unit tests \& Acceptance Tests?

\subsection{Why will this answer the Research Question}
The M-A system itself will not contribute towards answering the research question directly but will contribute towards the research study that will follow. 

%Long sentence that needs to be fixed LMAO
%\hl{This system will be used in my research to be compared with human designed interiors.}
