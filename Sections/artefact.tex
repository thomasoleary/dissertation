\section{Artefact}

\subsection{What will be made}
A Multi-Agent (M-A) system that generates the interior of a room at run time. This room will have a pre-defined room size, the system will also have access to pre-made furniture assets.
\hl{Something about using Real-Time walkthrough paper as an inspiration for the system}.

\subsection{How will I create it}
The AI will be made in the Unity game engine (Version 2020.3.12f1) \textbf{cite unity engine}

\subsection{How will I ensure Quality}
Quality control. Roadmap? Unit Testing? Integration testing?

\subsection{Why will this answer the questions}
The artefact itself will not contribute towards answering the research question but will contribute towards the research that will help with answering the question. Long sentence that needs to be fixed LMAO
\hl{This system will be used in my research to be compared with human designed interiors.}
