\section*{Ethical Considerations}
\label{append:c}

Due to this study requiring human participants, it will be signed off by Falmouth University's Research Ethics Board. The overall artefact is of low risk/concern and participants are able to opt out at any point during their participation.
Due to the nature of this study, no personal information about the participants involved will be collected - the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\cite{gdpr} does not need to be followed. However, to protect the participants rights, the Nuremberg Code will be followed to keep and ensure this research study is ethically sound\cite{nuremberg-code}. All participants will be handed a Participant Information Sheet that details the key information they must know before the study, a consent form is also supplied to ensure they have agreed to participate. Participants are still able to withdraw at any point until submitting data.
\subsubsection*{COVID-19}
At the current state of the pandemic and following the latest Government Guidelines in England \cite{gov-guidlines}, participants will be requested to wear a face covering during their participation. All surfaces will be sanitised between usages.
