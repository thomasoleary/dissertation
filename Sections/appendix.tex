\section*{Testing}
\label{append:f}
The Unit tests for my artefact were created using Unity's Test Framework and were used throughout the Artefact's development to validate the code and to ensure the Artefact worked as intended. (Unit testing code can be seen in Appendix H).
\\
A small pilot study was conducted with the help of some BSc peers. This pilot study was conducted to ensure the validity of my research methodology. It consisted of them taking part in my 2-staged A/B test, helping in testing the effectiveness of how room interiors were being represented - any feedback received from this small study was implemented into my methodology and no data from this pilot study was used within my data analysis.
