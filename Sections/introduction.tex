\section{Introduction}
Urban open world games such as Grand Theft Auto V \cite{game:gta}, The Division \cite{game:division} and Batman: Arkham Knight \cite{game:arkham-knight} have such large built-up areas for players to venture in. However, only a few handpicked buildings in these large cities are accessible and have  modelled interiors leaving the others to be blocked off for decorative purposes. This could be resolved by modelling and designing each room in these cities, but this would become incredibly impractical due to time constraints. Other issues with this can lean towards rendering and the storage of such heavily dense areas.

\subsection*{Procedural Generation}
Procedural Generation (PCG) refers to automatically creating content using algorithms \cite{what-is-pcg}. PCG has many applications in video games, some admirable examples being the world/cave generation in Minecraft \cite{game:minecraft}, the texture\cite{game:spore-texture} and world generation\cite{game:spore-world} in Spore \cite{game:spore} and the procedural texture and music generation in .kkrieger \cite{game:kkreiger}.

Using PCG, this largely time-consuming task of designing room interiors can be automated. And can possibly help maintain a player's immersion within the game - an issue with this however is that PCG tool's can be seen as boring and repetitive \cite[Chapter~2]{pcg_in_gd}.

Through my literature review, I have found many implementations and techniques of Procedural Interior Generation (PCIG) but only a few of these implementations are compared with Human Designed interiors to check its authenticity. My research is aimed towards testing a PCIG tool against human designed rooms in a user study. More specifically a Multi-Agent system that creates a rooms' interior.
