\section{Introduction}

Urban open world games such as Grand Theft Auto V \cite{game:gta}, The Division \cite{game:division} and Batman: Arkham Knight \cite{game:arkham-knight}
have such large built-up areas for players to venture in, but many buildings are blocked off - 
if you're lucky to have access to a building you are still very limited to the rooms you are able to enter.
Possibly ruining the immersion of the game for players.

This problem could be fixed by having developers designing each and every room in every single building within the vast urban environment.
But this would become a very time-consuming and impractical task.

Using Procedural Generation (PCG), this largely time-consuming task of designing room interiors can be automated. And can possibly help maintain a player's immersion within the game.

An issue with this however is that PCG tool's can be seen as boring and repetitive \cite{pcg_in_gd} 

Through my literature review though I have found many implementations and techniques of Procedural Interior Generation (PCIG), none of these get compared to Human designed interiors. 

This study looks to see if a participant is able to tell the difference between Human designed and AI generated interiors.
