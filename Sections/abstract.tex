%NEED TO REWRITE THIS SECTION
%This proposal is aimed around the research question "Can an Unknowing Participant distinguish between Multi-Agent Designed and Human Designed Interiors?". Before reaching this question I discuss the current implementations of Procedural Interior Generation in both video games and in papers produced from those of academic backgrounds. To help answer my question, I have proposed a computing artefact that will generate the interior of a room at run time - this artefact will be compared against human designed interiors in a User study to determine if it generates favourable layouts.

This dissertation is aimed towards answering the research question "Can an Unknowing Participant distinguish between Multi-Agent Designed and Human Designed Interiors?".
A research study was conducted with 56 participants, where each participant took part in a 5 minute 2-staged A/B test. In each stage, participants were shown 5 pairs of room interiors - one room being human designed and the other being designed by the artefact. In the first stage, they were informed to select the room they prefer and in the second stage they were informed that 1 room in each pair was Artefact designed, they were then told to select which one they believe was not human-made.
