%NEED TO REWRITE THIS SECTION
This proposal is aimed around the research question "Can an Unknowing Participant distinguish between Multi-Agent Designed and Human Designed Interiors?". Before reaching this question I discuss the current implementations of Procedural Interior Generation in both video games and in papers produced from those of academic backgrounds. To help answer my question, I have proposed a computing artefact that will generate the interior of a room at run time - this artefact will be compared against human designed interiors in a User study to determine if it generates favourable layouts.
