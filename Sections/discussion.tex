despite negative results
still information that can be used from this
to help progress the development of using procedural interior generation
look at fig~\ref{stage-1-graph} and fig~\ref{stage-2-graph}
in stage 1, data shows the artefact was picked slightly more than human but not significantly enough
in stage 2, data shows that the artefact was picked a lot more than human. despite failing the null hypothesis, if the hypothesis was "artefact is picked more often than human once Participants know" then it would've been able to reject the null hyppthesis
