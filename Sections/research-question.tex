\section{Research Question}

\hl{Through my literature review, there is evidence to show that PCIG should be compared to human designs more frequently to test its authenticity. With this I propose the following research question; \textbf{Can an Unknowing Participant distinguish between a Multi-Agent system and Human Designed Interiors?}}

\subsection{Hypothesizes}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item When unaware, the M-A System is picked more often than Human designed interiors by participants
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \hl{\textit{Null}: When unaware, the M-A System is not picked more often than Human designed interiors by participants}
        \end{itemize}
    \item When notified, the participant is not able to distinguish between human and M-A system interiors by participants
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \hl{\textit{Null}: When notified, the participant is able to distinguish between human and M-A system interiors by participants}
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
