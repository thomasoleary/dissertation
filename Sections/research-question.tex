\section{Research Question \& Artefact}
Through my literature review, there is evidence to show that PCIG should be compared to human designs more frequently to test its authenticity. With this I propose the following research question; \textit{Can an Unknowing Participant distinguish between a Multi-Agent Designed and Human Designed Interiors?}

\subsection{Hypotheses}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item When unaware, the M-A System is picked more often than Human designed interiors by participants
        %\begin{itemize}
        %    \item \hl{\textit{Null}: When unaware, the M-A System is not picked more often than Human designed interiors by participants}
        %\end{itemize}
    \item When notified, the participant is not able to distinguish between human and M-A system interiors
        %\begin{itemize}
        %    \item \hl{\textit{Null}: When notified, the participant is able to distinguish between human and M-A system interiors by participants}
        %\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Artefact}
The artefact is a Multi-Agent (M-A) system that will be used to create a room's furniture arrangement where each furniture is seen as an individual agent. The system is given an empty room and has access to pre-made furniture assets, at run time agents are spawned and arrange themselves accordingly (the behavior of a singular agent is demonstrated in \hyperref[activity-diagram]{Fig. 1}). The artefact will be influenced by the work from \textit{T. Germer, et al.} \cite{real-time-walkthroughs}.

\subsection{How it will be made} 
The Unity game engine\cite{unity} will be used for the implementation of the artefact as I have a few years of experience in creating other projects within its environment also the knowledge I have in C\# and Unity's classes help towards choosing what engine I would prefer to use.
I will also be closely following the Agile Methodology and its principles to help with the development life cycle as Agile is commonly used in Software Engineering and Game Development environments alike \cite{game-dev-agile}.

\subsection{Quality Assurance} 
I plan to use C\#'s \textit{NUnit Framework} \cite{nunit-framework} for Unit testing to ensure my Artefact works as intended.
