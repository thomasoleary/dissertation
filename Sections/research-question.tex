\section{Research Question \& Artefact}

Through my literature review, there is evidence to show that PCIG should be compared to human designs more frequently to test its authenticity. With this I propose the following research question; \textit{Can an Unknowing Participant distinguish between a Multi-Agent Designed and Human Designed Interiors?}

\subsection{Hypotheses}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item When unaware, the M-A System is picked more often than Human designed interiors by participants
        %\begin{itemize}
        %    \item \hl{\textit{Null}: When unaware, the M-A System is not picked more often than Human designed interiors by participants}
        %\end{itemize}
    \item When notified, the participant is not able to distinguish between human and M-A system interiors
        %\begin{itemize}
        %    \item \hl{\textit{Null}: When notified, the participant is able to distinguish between human and M-A system interiors by participants}
        %\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Artefact}

The artefact is a Multi-Agent (M-A) system that will be used to create a room's furniture arrangement where each furniture is seen as an individual agent. The system is given an empty room and has access to pre-made furniture assets, at run time agents are spawned and arrange themselves accordingly (the behavior of a singular agent is demonstrated in \hyperref[activity-diagram]{Fig. 1}). The artefact will be influenced by the work from \textit{T. Germer, et al.} \cite{real-time-walkthroughs}.

The Unity game engine will be used for the implementation \cite{unity} and I will also be following the Agile Methodology \cite{agile} to help me with the development life cycle of the artefact.
