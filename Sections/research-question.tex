\section{Research Question}

From the above sources, I have formed the question; \textbf{Can an Unknowing Participant distinguish between a Multi-Agent system and Human Designed Interiors?}

\subsection{Hypothesis \& null hypothesis}
\begin{itemize}
    \item When unaware, the M-A System is picked more often than Human designed interiors
    \item When notified, the participant is not able to distinguish between human and M-A system interiors
\end{itemize}
