A participant will be told that they must decide between a certain amount* of paired rooms labelled A and B. 
The participant will be told that there is something different between these rooms but should pick which room they prefer.

In each pair, one room is hand designed, the other is designed by Artificial Intelligence.

After picking out of these pairs which one they prefer â€“ the participant will be informed that one room in every pair is made by Artificial Intelligence.
Said participant will now be told to select which room (in each pair) they believe is made by Artificial Intelligence.
